    "body_markdown": "---\r\ntitle: \"Advice from an Ex-Con\"\r\npublished: true\r\ndescription: Lessons derived from a former product designer for Martha Stewart\r\ntags: career, beginners, mentalhealth\r\ncover_image: https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/i2nyn52wbliseku3387p.jpg\r\n---\r\n\r\nI recently attended a designers lightning talk, and one of the presenters used to work as a product designer for Martha Stewart. I thought the lessons derived from her talk would be relevant to devs as well.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 1. Be an expert, not a perfectionist\r\n\r\nMartha was known make employees cry. \r\n\r\nThis designer testified that Martha would throw a major fit if her product wasn't to her specifications: the logo is off by one pixel, it isn't the right shade of blue, the punctuation doesn't have the right amount of roundness, etc. of all the ridiculous expectations she had. \r\n\r\nAll of this, and, also, she expected you to read her mind. \r\n\r\nCommunication with her--well-- no one could even connect with her in the first place.\r\n\r\nYou can share your expertise and knowledge without being overbearing. \"Disguise\" them as mere suggestions. Always ask permission to share a critique if the conversation hasn't been prefaced with a request for one.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 2. Ignore haters, but don't ignore reality\r\n\r\nMartha has a daughter who ran a show called, \"Whatever, Martha\". Alexis Stewart reams her mother with criticisms and mockery simply because Martha wasn't physically and emotionally present throughout her life. \r\nShe resents her.\r\n\r\nMartha lives in a world where she is the absolute center of it. She paid no mind to those who didn't benefit her and her company. The reality is that her view of her world harmed many around her, especially her own daughter.\r\n\r\nIf the \"hater\" isn't someone of consequence and doesn't constructively provide any substantial reason why or how your product is lacking, then pay no mind. However, if your product isn't functioning correctly, is breaking everything else, and/or is receiving regular constructive criticism, maybe you should consider stepping back a few paces and look at your project as a whole.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 3. Work hard, but not that hard\r\nAs previously mentioned, Martha was a non-entity in her daughter's life all because she wanted to grow and optimize her DIY empire. She was so focused on the money, but her moves got messy-- thus resulting in incarceration.\r\n\r\nTakes breaks. Take steps back. Spend a little bit of that built up PTO. Allow yourself to breathe, then dive right back in.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 4. Commit to your vision, but stay flexible\r\nNothing is ever set in stone, and no road is ever perfect. Martha was unreasonably rigid in regards to the development of her products, resulting in constant turnovers in her company and sub-par product quality compared to other brands. Though her products do make the shelves, the overall rapport in the company and the products' quality are dismal. \r\n\r\nEven though you made a cut-and-dry plan of attack, everything could change at an instant: one of your teammates leaves, someone accidentally pushed an unstable experiment to prod, the whole building could collapse on your laptop.\r\n\r\nYou have the end goal in sight. Simply create a few contingency plans. \r\n\r\nBless cloud-based version control.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 5. Stay human\r\n\r\nThe designer witnessed Martha Stewart first-hand: Martha thought of herself as the greatest good Earth is ever-gonna-get. \r\n\r\nShe wasn't approachable. She wasn't reasonable.\r\n\r\nAccept your own flaws, but always strive to improve. Allow yourself to make mistakes and learn from them. \r\n\r\nDesign and develop products with empathy.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nGranted, we make mistakes. We will falter in all of these lessons at some point from here on out. What matters is that we get back up and simply do better and not make the same mistakes Martha has made.\r\n\r\n###TL;DR: Don't be like Martha.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThank you for reading!

This is also why I enrolled in a coding bootcamp! \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are definitely cheaper ways to get help: being active on dev Twitter (#100daysofcode helps with reach, or simply DM-ing or @-ing your favorite developer might do the trick), reaching out to others via here on DEV or the freecodecamp forums. If you're on FB, joining a specific group for your chosen language is a good idea!

    "body_markdown": "---\ntitle: 3 Things That'll Help You Learn Any New (Programming) Language\npublished: true\ndescription: The parallels between learning a foreign language and programming!\ntags: programming, beginners, codenewbie\ncover_image: https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/kqza4xiq41kd0qyy0qwo.gif\n---\nFun fact: I'm only partially-fluent in reading, writing, and speaking Japanese -- and in programming.\n\n\"Partially-fluent\" meaning I can understand the prompt, but only answer in English or put together a basic, rudimentary response, most of the time without aid of a guide or translator.\n\nI can ask for a bottle of beer in Japanese:\n\u003e ビール一個をください。/ \"Beeru ikko wo kudasai.\"\n\n**Programming, for me, is like this:** I have the essential vocabulary to at least communicate to the console to have it print, \"Hello World\". However, asking the browser to iterate, \"Hello World\" to me every time I load a page is a completely different and more complex request to communicate.\n\nTelling me to build an enterprise-level app from scratch fresh out of a coding bootcamp is akin to asking me to recite improvisational poetry in Japanese: *heckin' intimidating* and quite difficult with my current level of comprehension.\n\n## They're called programming *languages* for a reason.\n\nYou're learning how to sweet-talk a computer/phone/browser/raspberry pi into doing the thing you'd like it to do.\n\n![Joey from the TV show \"Friends\" saying, \"How you doin?\"](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/x8kp5ikxayf53009cazb.gif)\n\n## Here's a few things you can do when learning *any* language:\n\n### 1) **Practice, practice, practice-- every day!**\nFace it: you must make time *every day* to \"speak\" the language of choice. In my personal experience, I would tend to forget simple words if I don't practice, especially when reading and writing. \n\nIt's the same for programming: if I don't practice, I will forget the syntax for a for-loop.\n\nPracticing every day will help solidify concepts since you're consciously, continuously exposed to them. \n\nIt also helps to save time: you won't have to scour MDN/W3C for basic concepts anymore!\n\nIf you're on-the-go, download related apps. For reading Japanese, I highly recommend the \"[Kanji Study](https://mindtwisted.com/ \"Kanji Study\")\" app. For programming, I'm currently using \"[Mimo](https://getmimo.com/\"Mimo\")\".\n\n### 2) **Practice -- OUT LOUD.**\nYou need to speak out loud: hear yourself say the words and understand what they mean. Yes, even when you're coding, you need to say out-loud what exactly you are doing. \nFor example:\n\nReading Japanese:\n```\n日本語を読んでいます。\n```\n\nMy thought process out-loud:\n\u003e Kanji for day, kanji for book -- OH That's the kanji for Japan -- kanji for \"language\" -- all together it says \"Japanese\". \"を\"? That's a connector indicating it's an action being done. Kanji for \"to read\" with the connecting ender \"-ndeimasu\" meaning it's a current action being done. It says \"Nihongo wo yondeimasu\". \"I'm reading Japanese.\" Cool.\n\nProgramming in Javascript:\n\n```\nvar list = [ \"one\", \"two\", \"banana\" ];\nfor (i = 0; list.length \u003e i; i++)\n```\n\n\u003e \"For, by the way: 'i' is currently zero--Anyway, as long as the length of the list array is greater than the value of 'i', add 1 to 'i'.\"\n\nSpeaking out loud has the same effect as practicing every day: solidifying the meaning-- the \"why\" in your head in a different manner other than reading. You can only do so much just reading a concept, especially as a kinetic learner.\n\n### 3) **Practice -- with a partner who is fluent!**\nYou need someone with experience to help you: to show you the ropes, to guide you, to teach you what best practices are, and what phrases are used most often.\n\nGranted, it could be difficult to find someone who meshes with your personality/learning style/etc., but there is always someone out there who is willing to help you out. \n\nThis is what I didn't have while re-learning Japanese, and what I needed when learning how to code: I needed someone to *show me* how it's done correctly. This is also why I enrolled in a coding bootcamp! \n\nThere are definitely cheaper ways to get help: being active on dev Twitter (#100daysofcode helps with reach, or simply DM-ing or @-ing your favorite developer might do the trick), reaching out to others via here on DEV or the freecodecamp forums. If you're on FB, joining a specific group for your chosen language is a good idea! Posting on Stack Overflow sometimes helps (if you're a masochist). \n\nNow, I just need to have the courage to practice speaking Japanese out-loud with a native/fluent speaker.\n\n## TL;DR: Practice. Practice. Practice every day -- with intention. Don't be afraid to ask for help.\n\nI wish you luck on your own dev journey!\n\n---\n\n### **Question for the comments:**\n##If you're fluent in a foreign and/or programming language, what steps did you take to become fluent? What resources can you share that will help a newbie out?\n\n---\n\nThanks for reading!

    "body_markdown": "\u003e **CAVEAT:** *This article isn't exactly meant to be taken as coding law. This is simply my understanding and method of coding if/else statements! Find your own method or copy mine-- if you think it applies to your solution, then try it!*\n\n\u003eThis article also assumes you already know how to write for-loops and if/else statements in JavaScript.\n\n* EDIT 1/29/2020 at 4:35 PM: fixed the formatting of the code blocks and made it more readable*\n\n---\n\nIn some iteration of the infamous \"FizzBuzz\" question, you will be asked to:\n\n* Write a JavaScript application that logs all numbers from 1 - 100.\n* If a number is divisible by 3 log \"Fizz\" instead of the number.\n* If a number is divisible by 5 log \"Buzz\" instead of the number.\n* If a number is divisible by 3 and 5 log \"FizzBuzz\" instead of the number.\n\nLook at all those requirements. If you're like me -- someone who isn't exactly fond of math -- you'd either attempt to crunch numbers or walk away (and deal with it later. Maybe.)\n\n### But, honestly, the solution is simple and sweet:\n\nPresenting: **the modulo (%)**\n\n**What does it do?** It gives you the remainder--and *ONLY* the remainder.\n\nSince we're only finding numbers divisible by 3, 5, and both 3 and 5, the remainder *must* equal ZERO (0).\n\nSo at first, I wrote the solution like this:\n\n```javascript\nfor (i=0; i \u003c 100; i++){\n    if((i % 3) === 0){\n        console.log(\"Fizz\");\n   }\n    else if((i % 5) === 0){\n        console.log(\"Buzz\");\n    }\n   else if((i % 3) === 0 \u0026\u0026 (i % 5) === 0){\n        console.log(\"FizzBuzz\");\n    }\n   else {\n        console.log(i);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSuccess! Fizz's and Buzz's were being logged. \nBut wait-- not FizzBuzz's?\n\nI realized my mistake and forgot:\n\n### Code is executed from the top-down.\n\nSo I fixed it:\n\n```javascript\nfor (i=0; i \u003c 100; i++){\n    if((i % 3) === 0 \u0026\u0026 (i % 5) === 0){\n        console.log(\"FizzBuzz\");\n\t}\n    else if((i % 5) === 0){\n        console.log(\"Buzz\");\n\t}\n    else if((i % 3) === 0){\n        console.log(\"Fizz\");\n\t}\n    else {\n        console.log(i);\n\t}\n}\n```\n### This is where specificity comes in!\n\nWe have 3 requirements, with one involving numbers that have been previously mentioned: **3** *and* **5**.\n\nSince printing \"FizzBuzz\" has more requirements/rules, I moved it to the top to be executed first.\n\nMy mistake was that I wrote the code in the order of instruction.\n\n### **Bonus:** We can simplify the solution a bit more by changing the first if/else condition:\n\n* EDIT 1/29/2020 at 4:40 PM: DO NOT DO THIS. THINK OF SCALABILITY.\n\n```javascript\nif((i % 15) === 0){\n    console.log(\"FizzBuzz\");\n }\n```\nRemember: this *still* has to execute at the top. We're looking for numbers that divide by 3 *and* 5.\n\n**Why 15?** Typically, when dealing with division, one would think of it's opposite for the \"reverse\" solution: multiplication. \n\n---\n\nThat's it!! Hope you all found this useful! Feedback and constructive critique are always welcome in the comments or my DMs. :)\n\n---\n\n### **Question for the comments:**\n## What was the first programming problem you conquered, what language, and how did it feel when all the information finally clicked?\n\n---\n\nThanks for reading!

    "body_markdown": "Yo, (scarf) dog. I heard you like functions, so I put a function in ur function so that you can function while it functions.  \u003c / oldMemes \u003e\u003c / badJoke \u003e\n\n![Eevee shaking their head, disapproving of my bad joke](https://media.giphy.com/media/oabY4xGwzUB8c/giphy.gif)\n\nANYWAY, so my friend was starting to learn how to code and she needed help with understanding what the teacher was asking her to do.\n\nThis is what she sent me:\n```javascript\n/*\nCreate a function that takes in two inputs.\nOne should be a function and the other should be\nthe argument to call the input function with.\n\nThen in the function you define call the passed in function\nwith the input argument. \n*/\n```\n...excuse me, but lolwut?\n\nHere's the example function she sent:\n```javascript\nfunction sayHi(b,c){\nc=prompt(\"Greet me!\");\nb(c);\n```\nOkay, that's a bit more clear, I guess.\n\n---\n\n##So, here we go:\nFrom what I understand, we're looking to build a function that runs another function. I used the concept of **Pokémon evolution with stones** to illustrate this.\n\n![Eevee evolving in the Detective Pikachu movie](https://media.giphy.com/media/41fc5hcRsUBqotI7WD/giphy.gif)\n\n\n###*Evolution* is the overall universal function.\n```javascript\nfunction evolutionFn(pokemon, stone){\n  stone = prompt('Which stone will you use?');\n  return pokemon(stone);\n}\n```\n\nPokémon themselves are separate functions, but still universally utilize the same evolution function. The best example to use would be **Eevee** because the possibilities of their evolution are vast. (But for now, we're referencing their basic gen 1 evolutions).\n\n![Eevee tossing a flower crown onto their head](https://media.giphy.com/media/133cAiXr4T1te/giphy.gif)\n\n```javascript\nconst eevee = (x) =\u003e {\n  let userInput = x.toLowerCase();\n  if ( userInput === 'fire' ){\n    return 'Congrats! You now have a Flareon!'\n  }else if( userInput ==='thunder' ){\n    return 'Congrats! You now have a Jolteon!'\n  } else if( userInput === 'water' ){\n    return 'Congrats! You now have a Vaporeon!'\n  } else {\n    return 'Huh. It didn\\'t work.'\n  }\n}\n```\nI also created Pikachu to illustrate that a completely different Pokemon can utilize this method of evolution as well.\n\n![Raichu spinning Pikachu around while dancing](https://media.giphy.com/media/Fbj7lIkDbwNLa/giphy.gif)\n\n```javascript\nconst pikachu = (x) =\u003e {\n  let userInput = x.toLowerCase();\n  if ( userInput === 'thunder'){\n    return 'Congrats! You now have a Raichu!'\n  } else {\n    return 'Huh. It didn\\'t work.'\n  }\n}\n```\n\nPut it all together and we get the following:\n```javascript\nfunction evolutionFn(pokemon, stone){\n  stone = prompt('Which stone will you use?');\n  return pokemon(stone);\n}\n\nconst eevee = (x) =\u003e {\n  let userInput = x.toLowerCase();\n  if ( userInput === 'fire' ){\n    return 'Congrats! You now have a Flareon!'\n  }else if( userInput ==='thunder' ){\n    return 'Congrats! You now have a Jolteon!'\n  } else if( userInput === 'water' ){\n    return 'Congrats! You now have a Vaporeon!'\n  } else {\n    return 'Huh. It didn\\'t work.'\n  }\n}\n\nconst pikachu = (x) =\u003e {\n  let userInput = x.toLowerCase();\n  if ( userInput === 'thunder'){\n    return 'Congrats! You now have a Raichu!'\n  } else {\n    return 'Huh. It didn\\'t work.'\n  }\n}\n\nconsole.log(evolutionFn(eevee));\n// example: if prompt =\u003e 'fire or FIRE or even FiRe', \n// it will say \"Congrats! You now have a Flareon!\"\n// if it's anything else, the console will return \"Huh. It didn't work.\"\n\n\nconsole.log(evolutionFn(pikachu));\n// Should return \"Congrats you now have a Raichu\"! etc. etc.\n```\n---\n\n##**Play with it live on [Repl.it](https://repl.it/@catcarbonell/evolvefn)**!\n\n---\n\nAnd there you have it-- **Function composition: when you want to use a big function to execute little functions that essentially will output the same basic thing.** \n\nAlso, fun fact-- you've been bamboozled! If you've ever used .map(), .split(), .join(), .reverse(), you have already experienced Function Composition! We see this in action when we use JavaScript methods *ALL. THE.

    "body_markdown": "Hello everyone! Welcome to the first in a series! I'm going to try to explain a common software engineering interview question to better understand it and hopefully remember it when the time comes!\n\nThese problems will primarily be solved in JavaScript, as that is my language of choice when testing (and I just want to become a good front-end dev. 🥺)\n\n---\n\n## **Q: Find the second largest number in a given array.**\n**Params**: We are given an array of whole, positive integers (no negative numbers or floats). We are to write a function and return the second largest integer.\n\n##**Let's start!**\n\nWe'll write the skeleton of our function, setting the input/argument as **\"arr\"** for *array*:\n\n```javascript\nfunction secondLargest(arr){};\n```\nThen, we'll need to set two empty variables: *largest* and *second*.\n\n**Why?** We will need placeholders for both our prospective **largest** and **second** largest numbers as we loop through our array. \nWe want to keep track of each integer that is in the array and measure the value against the others \n\n```javascript\nfunction secondLargest(arr){ \n    let largest = '';\n    let second = '';\n}\n```\n\n...Which brings us to our next step: **create a for-loop!**\nAs we iterate through the array, we will measure each value against each other, comparing the variable \"largest\" to the current iteration value (arr[i]).\n\n```javascript\nfunction secondLargest(arr){\n    let largest = '';\n    let second = '';\n    //\n    for(let i=0; i \u003c arr.length; i++){};\n    //\n};\n```\nTo compare, we will create an **if-statement** comparing **largest** to **arr[i]**. \n\n\u003eIf **arr[i]** is greater than **largest**, then *replace it* with the current value of **arr[i]** by redeclaring **largest** and setting it equal to **arr[i]**\n\n```javascript\nfunction secondLargest(arr){\n    let largest = '';\n    let second = '';\n    for(let i=0; i \u003c arr.length; i++){\n        //\n        if(arr[i] \u003e largest){\n           largest = arr[i]\n        };\n       //\n    };\n};\n```\n\nWe found the largest number! But how do we get the **second** largest?\nWe did find it already (kind of): we'll just set the former \"largest\" number to the \"second\" variable.\n\nHOWEVER, we must declare the **second** variable BEFORE we declare the new **largest** number, simply because *order matters*-- JavaScript executes code from the top-down.\n\n```javascript\nfunction secondLargest(arr){\n    let largest = '';\n    let second = '';\n    for(let i=0; i \u003c arr.length; i++){\n        if(arr[i] \u003e largest){\n           //\n           second = largest;\n           //\n           largest = arr[i];\n        }; \n    };\n};\n```\n\nSpeaking of order and specificity, it's time we find the \"true\" second-largest number in the array.\n\nLet's create another if-statement with more specific parameters:\n\n\u003eIf the **arr[i]** is GREATER THAN *second* **AND** LESS THAN *largest*, then set **arr[i]** as *second*\n\n```javascript\nfunction secondLargest(arr){\n    let largest = '';\n    let second = '';\n    for(let i=0; i \u003c arr.length; i++){\n        if(arr[i] \u003e largest){\n           second = largest;\n           largest = arr[i];\n        };\n        //\n        if(arr[i] \u003e second \u0026\u0026 arr[i]\u003c largest){\n           second = arr[i];\n        };\n        // \n    };\n};\n```\n\nFinally, we'll return our *second* variable to complete the requirement.\n\n```javascript\nfunction secondLargest(arr){\n    let largest = '';\n    let second = '';\n    for(let i=0; i \u003c arr.length; i++){\n        if(arr[i] \u003e largest){\n           second = largest;\n           largest = arr[i];\n        };\n        if(arr[i] \u003e second \u0026\u0026 arr[i]\u003c largest){\n           second = arr[i];\n        };\n    };\n    //\n    return second;\n    //\n};\n```\n---\n\nAnd there you have it! It's a fairly simple solution, a bit long since we're using a traditional for-loop, but it works!\n\nFeel free to post your own solutions in your programming language of choice in the comments!\n\n---\n\n###Thanks for reading!\nIf you'd like to keep in touch, please reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/catcarbn)!\n",

I set it as a const variable **splitString** so I could call on it later.\n\nNext, I thought of iterating through this new array, and so I utilized a **classic for-loop**\n\n```javascript\nfunction revFunction(str){\n   const splitString =  str.split('');\n   for(let i = 0; i \u003c= str.length; i++){}\n};\n```\n\nNow, what do I do when iterating through str? Yes, I need to go through them individually, but I need to iterate the other way. I asked if I could use **.pop()** since pop removes the last item in an array. He gave me the go-ahead.\n\n```javascript\nfunction revFunction(str){\n   const splitString =  str.split('');\n   for(let i = 0; i \u003c= str.length; i++){\n      // --------\n      splitString.pop();\n      // --------\n   }\n};\n```\n\nBut we need that last letter!

My solution to hold the popped item was to **.push()** it into a new, empty array.\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction revFunction(str){\n   const splitString =  str.split('');\n   // --------\n   const reversedString = [];\n   // --------\n   for(let i = 0; i \u003c= str.length; i++){\n      // --------\n       reversedString.push(splitString.pop());\n      // --------\n   }\n};\n```\n\nAt this point, if we console.log the revFunction, it will return as an array.\n\n\n```javascript\n// [!,e,m, ,e,s,r,e,v,e,R]\n```\nSuccess!\n\nBut, the interviewer wanted the function to return a solid string. I asked if I could use **.join()**. He approved.\n\n```javascript\nfunction revFunction(str){\n   const splitString =  str.split('');\n   const reversedString = [];\n   for(let i = 0; i \u003c= str.length; i++){\n       reversedString.push(splitString.pop());\n   }\n   // ---- //\n   return reversedString.join('');\n   // ---- //\n};\n```\n\nThis should return:\n\n```javascript\n//!em esreveR\n```\n---\n\nWe did it! There are many ways to reverse a string without the **.reverse()** method. What I covered was the **iterative** way (*iterating* with a for-loop). \n\n##I challenge you to solve this challenge (in your language of choice) in the comments!\n\n---\n\n###[Try it out on my Repl!](https://repl.it/@catcarbonell/reverseString)\n\n---\n\n###Thanks for reading!!\nGot a beginner-level interview question for me?
